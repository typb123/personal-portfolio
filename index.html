            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Originally from Northern California, I'm currently a junior at the University of Oregon, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science, 
                with an anticipated graduation date of June 2026. My journey into technology began with an innate curiosity for how things 
                work. During the coronavirus pandemic and initially through YouTube, I discovered a deep fascination for physics and the universe. 
                Inspired by renowned astrophysicists like Stephen Hawking, Brian Cox, Brian Greene, and others, I continue to explore these 
                concepts through reading and independent study.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though tempted to major in physics, I ultimately chose to continue to channel my passion into mathematics and computer science. 
                I believe that my technical education can seamlessly blend with my personal interests. Professionally, I am particularly drawn 
                to backend software engineering, excited by the possibilities of creating robust and scalable systems. My interest areas—such as 
                space-based technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning—reflect a personal enthusiasm, but I remain versatile and 
                eager to contribute my skills across various domains within computer science.
            </p>        

            <p>
                Before attending the University of Oregon, I completed my general education at Portland Community College while simultaneously 
                working full-time in the kitchen of a retirement home. These experiences in the food industry profoundly shaped my professional character. 
                I developed strong customer service abilities through direct resident interaction, honed my capacity to collaborate effectively within 
                diverse teams, and cultivated resilience and adaptability in dynamic, high-pressure environments.    
                
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, I'm ready to integrate these invaluable soft skills with my technical knowledge to excel in a technical role. Whether it's developing 
                innovative backend solutions, contributing to groundbreaking space exploration projects, or advancing AI capabilities, I am committed to leveraging 
                my unique blend of experiences to make meaningful contributions.

                <h3>PyStockProj</h3>
                <p>
                    A Python tool for predicting stock prices, built with scikit-learn for preprocessing and linear regression, 
                    XGBoost for model training, pandas for data manipulation, and CUDA for performance optimization. 
                    It forecasts stock prices 5 days ahead by analyzing historical data and employing feature engineering techniques 
                    such as technical indicators. This project allowed me to gain deeper insights into machine learning pipelines and 
                    the challenges of time series prediction.
